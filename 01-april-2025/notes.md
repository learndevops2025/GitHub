GitHub Administration Steps
✅ Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
Email: kkeducationblr@gmail.com
Password: P@a
Username: kkeducation1234567
Public URL: https://github.com/
Enterprise URL: https://airtel.github.com/
⚠️ Always use strong passwords and enable 2FA for security.



✅ Step 2: Log in to GitHub
Navigate to GitHub Login
Enter your credentials and access the dashboard.


✅ Step 3: Create an Organization
Organization Name: bsnl-4g-test
Add service accounts only (not personal emails):
❌ kkeducationblr@gmail.com
❌ prasanth@bsnl.com
✅ devops4g@bsnl.com


✅ Step 4: Create Repositories
Create both public and private repositories under the organization.

🔒 Private Repo: testing-private-repo
🌐 Public Repo: testing-public-repo


✅ Step 5: Create Teams
Create specific teams for access and collaboration:

Dev Team: bsnl-dev-team
DevOps Team: bsnl-DevOps-Team
(Optional): QA, SRE, DB, etc.

✅ Step 6: Add Users to Teams
Assign GitHub usernames or verified email addresses to each team:

bsnl-dev-team: Developers
bsnl-DevOps-Team: Infra and automation
bsnl-qa-team: QA Engineers
bsnl-sre-team: Site Reliability Engineers
bsnl-db-team: DB Admins


✅ Step 7: Grant Repository Access to Teams
Configure repository permissions for each team:

Read, Write, or Admin privileges as needed.
Example:
Devs: Read/Write
DevOps: Admin
QA: Read
DB: Read/Write

✅ Step 8: Manage Access & Clean-up
Convert Repository Visibility:

Public ↔ Private (can be changed anytime under repo settings)
Delete:

Users
Teams
Repositories
Organization (if no longer required)
Note: Deletion is permanent. Take backup or transfer ownership before deletion.

Additional Best Practices
Enable branch protection rules.
Enforce code reviews before merging.
Setup webhooks or GitHub Actions for automation.
Regularly review audit logs for access tracking.
Use service accounts for automation instead of personal credentials.
